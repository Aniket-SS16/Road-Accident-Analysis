# Road-Accident-Analysis
Built an interactive Road Accident Analysis Report for years 2021 and 2022 using Microsoft Power BI. The report analyzed the causes of accidents due to various factors such as road surface, light conditions, etc. Raw data was imported in a PostgreSQL database and then connected to Power BI Desktop. Time-independent functions like TOTALYTD and SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR were used to compare the year-on-year data to gain insights. The report also includes customized visualizations to make it more interactive. #DataAnalysis #PowerBI #RoadSafety
